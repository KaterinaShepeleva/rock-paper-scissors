        <h3>Rules of the game</h3>
        <p>
            An easily memorised rule determines the winner:
            “Rock breaks scissors, scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock.”
        </p>
        <p>
            In other words, a player who chooses rock beats one who chooses scissors; scissors in turn beats paper;
            paper beats rock. This yields a winner whenever the two players choose differently.
        </p>
